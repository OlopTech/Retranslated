# Retranslated: A translating system based in PHP

## How to Install
1. Open the `installer.php` file available in the releases.
2. This will automatically install the system.

## How to Use It
After the installation, follow these steps:

1. In your PHP files, add the line `<?php require 'translation.php'; ?>`. This line should only be added to the files that you accepted during the installation process.
2. Within these files, you can add lines of code for translation like this: `<?php echo translate('main.text'); ?>`.
3. Make sure to add the translation keys (e.g., `main.text`) in the JSON files.
